# The Author

I am a web developer working and living in Cleveland, OH. I work with mostly Ruby on Rails and Javascript with some legacy PHP thrown in there. I have been developing professionally since 2010 and as a hobby before that.

When I am not working on code, I enjoy board games with friends, PC games, and seeing the latest movies. Although new to Cleveland, I was born and raised in Ohio.
